Nonrepudiation in digital systems means ensuring that a user cannot deny performing a specific 
action, such as sending a message, approving a payment, or making a purchase. It provides reliable 
proof of who performed an action and when it happened. This is usually achieved by combining 
identity verification, secure records, and cryptographic techniques so that actions are traceable 
and verifiable.

Nonrepudiation is especially important for applications like online bookstores because transactions 
involve payments, orders, and digital records that may later be disputed. For example, a customer 
might claim they never placed an order, or a seller might deny processing a purchase. By implementing 
nonrepudiation mechanisms, the system can provide evidence showing that a transaction was authorized 
and completed, protecting both customers and businesses while reducing fraud and legal conflicts.

Besides logging, several tools and technologies help achieve nonrepudiation. Digital signatures use 
cryptography to verify that a message or transaction came from a specific user and has not been 
altered. Audit trails maintain a secure, chronological history of system activities, making it 
easier to trace events. Blockchain technology can also support nonrepudiation by storing transaction 
records in a decentralized and tamper-resistant way. Additionally, multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
and public key infrastructure (PKI) strengthen identity verification, ensuring that actions are strongly
 tied to legitimate users. Together, these technologies create trustworthy digital evidence and 
 accountability in modern systems.
